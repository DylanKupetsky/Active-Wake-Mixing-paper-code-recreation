# Active-Wake-Mixing-paper-code-recreation
Partial recreation of Cheung (2025) paper on active wake mixing with parabolic technique. The paper can be found [here](https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/10/1403/2025/wes-10-1403-2025.html). 

We simulate Eqs. 7 without the forcing taken from linear stability.
